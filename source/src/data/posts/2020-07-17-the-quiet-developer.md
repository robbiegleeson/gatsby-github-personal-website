It seems to me that the industry of software development as we know it has evolved rapidly over the past several years. No longer do you have to be **just** good at what you do - but you also have to have a certain presence that surrounds you! You need to be a blogger, to have opinions on every aspect of whatever part of the software development lifecycle you are involed in. If you don't then you are fall in to the bracket of a 9-5 developer - someone who just does it as a job, rather than a passion and therefore can't be taken seriously.

Don't think for a minute that I don't get the irony of me writing this post - my agenda here isn't to become a social media development guru. No, quite the opposite actually. I'm here to say that's it ok that you don't contribute to open source projects - that's it's ok that you don't contribute to the likes of [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Just because you have a life outside of the industry doesn't make you any less of a developer. Just because you are not so opinionated in team discussions or online doens't make you any less relevant.

I've come to the realisation that my skills and contributions (despite what my github contributions guide say) as a developer are just as important and relevant to those developers who have a lot to say! Yes I read articles online to improve myself and I acknowledge those people who do so much to educate so many. But if you think that in order to be taken seriously as a developer that you have to be active on Twitter and other social media sites, that you have to be the only voice in the room then you're wrong!

If you're like me and sometimes feels like that just because you have nothing to say means that you're not as good a developer as the next guy then think again. From my experience you probably know more than that guy! You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar!
